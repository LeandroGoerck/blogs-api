## üöÄ Skills

- Create and associate tables using sequelize models;
- Build endpoints to consume the created models;
- Make a CRUD with ORM.

## üîß Development

This project uses Sequelize and ExpressJS to build an API that CRUD blog posts. 

## üìù Project features

- [x] 1. Your application must have the POST `/user` endpoint

- The endpoint can add a new user to the database table;

- The request body must have the following format:

  ```json
  {
    "displayName": "Brett Wiltshire",
    "email": "brett@email.com",
    "password": "123456",
    "image": "http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_YA50adQ-7vQ/S1gfR_6ufpI/AAAAAAAAAAk/1ErJGgRWZDg/S45/brett.png"
  }
  ```
- The `displayName` field must be a string with at least 8 characters;

- The `email` field will be considered valid if it has the format `<prefix>@<domain>` and is unique. It is mandatory.

- The password must contain 6 characters. It is mandatory.

- If there is a person with the same email in the base, the following error should be returned:

  ```json
  {
    "message": "User already registered"
  }
  ```

- Otherwise, return the same response from the `/login` endpoint, a `JWT` token:

  ```json
  {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJwYXlsb2FkIjp7ImlkIjo1LCJkaXNwbGF5TmFtZSI6InVzdWFyaW8gZGUgdGVzdGUiLCJlbWFpbCI6InRlc3RlQGVtYWlsLmNvbSIsImltYWdlIjoibnVsbCJ9LCJpYXQiOjE2MjAyNDQxODcsImV4cCI6MTYyMDY3NjE4N30.Roc4byj6mYakYqd9LTCozU1hd9k_Vw5IWKGL4hcCVG8"
  }
  ```
 _The previous token is fictitious_

##

- The body of the request should follow the format below:

  }
  ```

- If any of these fields is invalid or there is no corresponding user in the database, return a status code 400 with the body `{ message: "Invalid fields" }`.

- If everything is ok with the login, the response should be a `JWT` token, in the following format:

  ```json
  {
    "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJwYXlsb2FkIjp7ImlkIjo1LCJkaXNwbGF5TmFtZSI6InVzdWFyaW8gZGUgdGVzdGUiLCJlbWFpbCI6InRlc3RlQGVtYWlsLmNvbSIsImltYWdlIjoibnVsbCJ9LCJpYXQiOjE2MjAyNDQxODcsImV4cCI6MTYyMDY3NjE4N30.Roc4byj6mYakYqd9LTCozU1hd9k_Vw5IWKGL4hcCVG8"
